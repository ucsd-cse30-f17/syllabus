# Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 10% for on-line reading/lecture review quizzes
- 10% for in-class participation via clickers
- 35% for programming/homework assignments (7-9 total assignments)
- 25% for 2 mid-term tests (10% for the lower grade, 15% for the higher one)
- 20% for a final exam

Above 90% is a guaranteed A- or better, above 80% is a guaranteed B- or better, and above 70% is a guaranteed C- or better.

These thresholds may be lowered, but will not be raised.


## Reading/lecture Review Quizzes

There will be 1-2 reading and review quizzes per week, done online. These are primarily to get you to engage with and reflect on lectures and readings. They also give you a set of questions that are useful to study for later exams.

Not all lectures will have readings assigned, but many will.

## Participation

We will use clickers in class. You will get a participation grade based on the proportion of clicker reponses you give. Correctness is _not_ taken into account in calculating this part of your grade, just participation in the questions.

## Programming/Homework Assignments

Most weeks will feature a programming or homework assignment. This will usually involve logging into the Raspberry Pi cluster and writing some C or assembly code and handing it in. Some weeks may have short response questions or problem sets.

The weight of the assignments towards the total 35% may adjust slightly over the quarter. We will provide more detail on this as the course goes on.

## Midterm Tests

There will be two midterm tests, on **fill** and **fill**, which will be given in-class.

Your grade 

## Final Exam

There will be a cumulative final exam.
