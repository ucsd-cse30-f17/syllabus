# Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 5% for on-line reading/lecture review quizzes
- 10% for in-class participation via clickers
- 40% for programming/homework assignments (7-8 total assignments)
- 25% for 2 mid-term tests (10% for the lower grade, 15% for the higher one)
- 20% for a final exam

Above 90% is a guaranteed A- or better, above 80% is a guaranteed B- or better, and above 70% is a guaranteed C- or better.

These thresholds may be lowered, but will not be raised.


## Reading/lecture Review Quizzes

There will be 1-3 reading and review quizzes per week, done online. These are primarily to get you to engage with and reflect on lectures and readings. They also give you a set of questions that are useful to study for later exams. You get full credit for each quiz where you get at least half the questions right.

Not all lectures will have readings assigned, but many will.

## Participation/clickers

We will use clickers in class. You will get a participation grade based on the proportion of clicker reponses you give. Correctness is _not_ taken into account in calculating this part of your grade, just participation in the questions.

We might not use clickers in every lecture. Your clicker points will be calculated by:

    MIN(1, lectures where you participated / (total # of clicker lectures - 4)) * 10
    
That is, you can miss up to 4 lectures with clicker questions without it affecting your grade. There will probably be between 20 and 25 total lectures with clicker questions.

## Programming/Homework Assignments

Most weeks will feature a programming or homework assignment. This will usually involve logging into the Raspberry Pi cluster and writing some C or assembly code and handing it in. Some weeks may have short response questions or problem sets.

The weight of the assignments towards the total 40% may adjust slightly over the quarter. We will provide more detail on this as the course goes on.

Programming assignments can be submitted up to 24 hours late with a 20% penalty on the total number of points.

## Midterm Tests

There will be two midterm tests, on **October 20** and **November 13**, which will be given in-class.

The one on which you get a higher score will count for 15% of your final grade, the one on which you get a lower score will count for 10% of your final grade.

## Final Exam

There will be a cumulative final exam. Its format will be similar to the midterm tests.
