# Course Policies

## Academic Honesty

This course is governed by an academic honesty policy that enforces academic integrity (e.g. no cheating). See https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/forms/form-scholarship-agreement.html for an overview of what constitutes an academic integrity violation in a CSE course. Assignments will be clear on when they are intended to be collaborative versus individual work.

## Asking for Help

We want to help, and you should be asking lots of questions! The guidelines below are to make sure we can give you prompt and effective assistance.

### In Lab Hours

We have a number of lab hours, where tutors and TAs are available to help, in B260 in the CSE building. We will use Autograder (https://autograder.ucsd.edu/) to manage requests for help. The schedule of hours will be posted early in the second week. 

When you submit an Autograder ticket, you must have an actionable question. We may simply respond and tell you to ask a more specific question if you submit a ticket with an issue like “My code isn't working”. When the tutor arrives at your workstation, be ready to describe the problem you're having, and at least one thing you've tried in order to solve it.

You should _not_ expect to have your problem solved by the time a tutor leaves your workstation. Instead, you should expect to have a concrete next step to work on, which may mean going back a step and re-trying something, working on more testing, or reviewing reading and lecture material that will help you understand the problem.

### Piazza Questions

One way to ask a question is via a Piazza post. The default on our Piazza board is for questions to be _private_. You are also welcome to ask and answer public questions! Before you do, consider:

- Does it contribute to a positive, constructive, and respectful forum for discussion and learning?
- Does it contain contain your personal source code, or other information that shouldn't be shared class-wide?
- Is it a question that's been asked before, that you could find via searching?

We will make private posts that violate these guidelines. We may summarize and make public good questions that are asked privately, as well. Overall, our goal is to make the public content on Piazza constructive and relevant for everyone.

In your question, clearly indicate the problem you're having or question you need answered, and feel free to share any supporting code or screenshots that may help us understand what's going on. If it's a simple technical issue, you might get a direct answer. If it's a question about an assignment, expect to get questions back that lead you towards a better understanding, _not_ an immediate answer that solves your problem.

We will, for each assignment, aggregate together a frequently asked questions post that draws from questions we receive in office hours and via Piazza posts. If you ask a question that's already answered in that post, we'll likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated as new important questions and answers come in.

For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official. They could be downright wrong or misleading, completely by accident. “My classmate said so on Piazza” is not justification for a decision you made when arguing about a grade, for instance. In public discussions, the same guidelines as above apply – act professionally and with a sense of respect for one another and for the course staff.

### Private/sensitive Questions

If you have a question that is about an academic accommodation, special circumstance, or private matter that should only be shared with the instructor and not the course staff, send email to `jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`, and include `CSE30 Student` in the subject line.
