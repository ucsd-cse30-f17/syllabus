## How to Ask a Course Question On-Line

This refers to asking questions _outside_ of class, not in class (where it will be clear whether you should raise your hand, shout out answers, use a clicker, etc).

### General Questions

The best way to ask a question is via a private Piazza post. The default on our Piazza board is for questions to be _private_.

Please _do not_ post public questions or notes.

We know that this may differ from how you use Piazza in other courses. The goal is to cut down on the public-facing volume of posts to search, and the amount of potentially-ambiguous answers that can arise via quick responses on public posts.

In your question, clearly indicate the problem you're having or question you need answered, and feel free to share any supporting code or screenshots that may help us understand what's going on. If it's a simple technical issue, you might get a direct answer. If it's a question about an assignment, expect to get questions back that lead you towards a better understanding.

Our goal is to get you a response within 36 hours of weekday time; over the weekend expect a response within 72 hours. Note that this means questions asked on the day of a deadline are not guaranteed to get a response before the deadline.

We will, for each assignment and week of lectures, aggregate together a frequently asked questions post that draws from questions we receive in office hours and via private Piazza posts. If you ask a question that's already answered in that post, we'll likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated daily.

If you want to have an additional public discussion with your classmates, feel free to do so in the follow-ups to these frequently-asked-question posts. However, note that answers from your classmates are not official

### Private/sensitive Questions

If you have a question that is about an academic accommodation, special circumstance, or private matter that should only be shared with the instructor and not the course staff, send email to `jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`, and include `CSE30 Student` in the subject line.
